                <h1><i class="fa-brands fa-html5"></i>HTML</h1>
                <p>
                    I originally learned HTML about a year ago when I wanted to take coding
                    to the next step. From that point, the only "language" I knew was Scratch,
                    And it wasn't really cutting it anymore. That's when I went onto w3schools 
                    and began to learn HTML.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="cssC" class="tc">
                <h1><i class="fa-brands fa-css3-alt"></i>CSS</h1>
                <p>
                    I learned css because I wanted to take my websites to the next level, and
                    what beter way than with css. It was first slightly confusing but got easier
                    the more I practiced. I never understood why poeple hated css, because once
                    I got the hang of it I loved it. 
                </p>

            <div id="pyC" class="tc">
                <h1><i class="fa-brands fa-python"></i>Python</h1>
                <p>
                    Coding in HTML and CSS was cool enough for me, but I wanted to learn a real
                    language; one that was easy to learn yet functional for any use. That's when 
                    I began learning Python. I loved the syntax and the simplicity. It was easy to
                    set up a python REPL and then just code. I used the lanuggae for a veryt long 
                    time before learning Javascript and React.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="jsC" class="tc">
                <h1><i class="fa-brands fa-js-square"></i>Javascript</h1>
                <p>
                    Javascript was obviously the next step in adding functionality to my pretty barebones
                    websites at the time. I first began using it for frontend projects before learning how 
                    to use Node.JS and electron. Javascript used to be my #1 most hated language before I
                    tried it and got good. Now I love the syntax and almost everything about it!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="reactC" class="tc">
                <h1><i class="fa-brands fa-react"></i>React</h1>
                <p>
                    Since I was getting so good at Javascript fullstack, I had to learn a frontend 
                    framework so I could take my web development to the next level. I decided on react 
                    because of it's stature in frontend framework. I really love the syntax and how easy
                    it is to import to any Node.js project. I would have probably even built this website
                    on react if github pages wasn't a static only hosting program.  
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="sassC" class="tc">
                <h1><i class="fa-brands fa-sass"></i>Sass</h1>
                <p>
                    CSS is a great lanuage, don't get me wrong, but sometimes it feels almost lacking. That's 
                    why I picked up sass. I learned it because it was just css but just better in general. I was
                    working on a project that would require sass so thats kinda why I picked it up, but now I can't 
                    live without sass. Every project always needs sass. Did you know even this website is built using
                    sass? To say the least, I love sass.
